# tello-follow-faces
## Drone Programming Semester Project

*This project requires Python 3.10 or newer.*

**Project requirements:**
- [x] Tello takes off and ascends to about 1.5m (human face level)
- [x] Rotates slowly in yaw (scans the surroundings)
- [x] If the face is detected, drone tries to:
  - [x]  Keep the target in the middle of the screen (by controlling yaw and altitude, position control optional)
  - [x]  Maintain distance to target
